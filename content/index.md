# Welcome to the official `boated` Minecraft server wiki!
We are currently hosting 720 notes and aim to be the most comprehensive reference for the mods and features added to the game.
Many links on this wiki redirect to official mod wikis that are more fleshed out in content. This content mainly serves to detail the changes made to these mods in order to balance the server. Additionally, it documents information for mods that have lacking or no wikis.

> [!info] Archaic documentation warning: Currently, only [[EEEAB's Mobs]], [[L_Ender's Cataclysm]], and some parts of [[Alex's Caves]] and [[Born in Chaos]] have self-contained wiki sections with their items. For example, [[Ignis]] links to [[Cataclysm Items#The Incinerator]] rather than its own unique page on the [[Items]] page. To maintain better order for the Wiki, these two 4 will be the only content mods to follow this structure. Editors should redirect links to items to the [[Items]] page and add a link to their mod in their entry.

What does this mean for viewers? Nothing! The [[Items]] page should be fully functional and this update will not affect your viewing of the wiki at all. However, when browsing the Mob/Boss pages of the above mods, they may link to archaic individual item pages. The official Items page should be the most reliable source.
