This is not an installation guide! For a guide on how to install the mods and join the server, visit [[Installation Guide]].

Welcome to the server! There are some brief things you should know about the server before getting started. Firstly, you might want to get familiar with the wiki. It has a lot of great in-depth information about the mods in place. If not, this guide is a good place to start! The most significant content mods are [[Born in Chaos]], [[L_Ender's Cataclysm]], and [[Alex's Caves]], and provide some of the biggest challenges content-wise.

You should also get familiar with the [[Death]] and [[PvP Flagging]] systems. Also, if you want to voice chat with other players, you can use the Discord and/or turn on proximity voice chat by setting up Simple Voice Chat! Just click V and it'll get you started.

Before playing, you might also want to check your settings. By default, many of the settings are not conflicting; except, notably, if you are using Push to Talk on Simple Voice Chat, you will have to bind it to a different key than V (or change the Simple Voice Chat UI button to something else).

One of the first things you will notice is that there are a LOT of new mobs roaming the world. A major difference between vanilla Minecraft is that a lot of content is simply gated by gear progression. In vanilla, you can defeat many mobs with no armor and a sword. On this server, combat with mobs will be a lot more challenging.

> Starting from night 3, you may encounter a pair of glowing eyes. This is the [[Nightmare Stalker]] and you must attack it to make it visible. 

Other important content details you should know:
- This server uses Better Combat/Combat Roll. To disable arms, go to the Mods menu and search up Better Combat. Click the Config and disable arms in first person.
	- This means spam-clicking is completely disabled. Weapons also have new animations.
	- For more information: [[Better Combat]] & [[Combat Roll]]
- Day/night cycles have been adjusted to compensate for higher difficulty. Daytime lasts 30 minutes. Night lasts 15 minutes (This is an increase from vanilla, which is a 20 minute cycle).
- Any player can speed up nighttime by sleeping in a bed. This speed-up effect increases when more players are sleeping.
- Boss fights have been scaled to be more difficult (especially due to an overall nerf in weapon damage). It's a good idea to go fighting mobs with a friend!
- You will probably die a LOT during major boss fights. A bed might be necessary so you can return in the middle of a fight. To keep your home set, you can use [[Waystones]], which cost XP to use.
- Xaero's Minimap and World Map are enabled by default (with Waystones integration).

To learn more about the mods in the server as you encounter them, you should make heavy usage of [[Mod Directory#Optional Mods|JEI]]. JEI lets you look at how an item is crafted (hover and click R by default) or what it is used for (hover and click U by default).
