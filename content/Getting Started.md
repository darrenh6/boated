Welcome to the server! There are some brief things you should know about the server before getting started. Firstly, you might want to get familiar with the wiki. It has a lot of great in-depth information about the mods in place. If not, this guide is a good place to start! The most significant content mods are [[Born in Chaos]], [[L_Ender's Cataclysm]], and [[Alex's Caves]], and provide some of the biggest challenges content-wise.

You should also get familiar with the [[Death]] and [[PvP Flagging]] systems. Also, if you want to voice chat with other players, you can use the Discord and/or turn on proximity voice chat by setting up Simple Voice Chat! Just click V and it'll get you started.

One of the first things you will notice is that there are a LOT of new mobs roaming the world. A major difference between vanilla Minecraft is that a lot of content is simply gated by gear progression. In vanilla, you can defeat many mobs with no armor and a sword. On this server, combat with mobs will be a lot more challenging.

> Starting from night 3, you may encounter a pair of glowing eyes. This is the [[Nightmare Stalker]] and you must attack it to make it visible. 

This is just one of the many dangerous mobs throughout the server. One of the mechanics used to counteract this difficulty is longer days (30 minutes) to prepare and relatively shorter nights (15 minutes). This day and night cycle also makes the window for mob farming and content slightly shorter, so you should pay close attention to when you will be able to go adventure! Additionally, this feature makes it so that time passes slightly faster when anybody is sleeping. The more people that are sleeping, the faster the night will pass.

boated also uses the [[Waystones]] mod with Xaero's Minimap integration. This is a great tool to use to set your homes and points of interest, as you may find yourself needing to use beds as spawnpoints during boss fights.

Boss fights in general have been scaled up in difficulty compared to the overall nerfed weapons. This change was made to encourage teaming up to defeat bosses.

To learn more about the mods in the server as you encounter them, you should make heavy usage of [[Mod Directory#Optional Mods|JEI]]. JEI lets you look at how an item is crafted (hover and click R by default) or what it is used for (hover and click U by default).

Okay, that's it for a low-effort & attention span guide. Good luck and have fun!
