Players can flag or unflag themselves to opt into PVP. Both players must be flagged for PVP to occur.

Admins can create areas for PVP that will flag players when they enter the area (warning as you get close). If you want to build an official arena, tell us on Discord and we will PvP-Zone your creation.
