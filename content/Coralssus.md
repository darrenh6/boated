The **Coralssus** is a miniboss found in the Sunken City. It has similar attacks to the [[Coral Golem]]. When Coralssus lets out a roar, it will perform a series of punch attacks while charging towards the player. Itâ€™s best to run away when this happens because these attacks can deal significant damage and knockback.

Upon being slain, the Coralssus drops a Coral Chunk, which is needed to craft the Abyssal Sacrifice. This item is required to summon the [[Leviathan]].
