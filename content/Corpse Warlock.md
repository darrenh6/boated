The **Corpse Warlock** is a miniboss that spawns in the Nether. It can only be found on a Bloody Altar, which can be located with an [[EEEAB's Mobs#Getting Started|Eye of Bloody Altar]].

The Corpse Warlock begins the fight by casting a spell (indicated with a red eye) that summons [[Corpse|Corpses]]. Afterwards, it uses a series of magic attacks, calling down red beams from the sky. The Corpse Warlock also has a teleport spell that allows it to evade attacks. Corpses will continue to spawn until the Corpse Warlock is defeated.

Upon being slain, the Corpse Warlock drops the Heart of Pagan. The Heart was previously used for the [[EEEAB's Mobs#Getting Started|Eye of Guling]], but it is now used to brew the Potion of Frenzy. When Frenzied, you gain both strength and speed. This effect stacks with the default strength and speed effects.
