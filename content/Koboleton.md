The **Koboleton** is a weak mob that roams the Cursed Pyramid. However, it can steal your items, such as your sword in hand! To counter this, you will need Sticky Gloves, which can be equipped to your Belt slot in [[Curios API]].

Upon being slain, the Koboleton has a small chance to drop Ancient Metal Ingots, which are used to craft [[Cataclysm Items#Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate|Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate]].
