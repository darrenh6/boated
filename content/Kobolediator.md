The **Kobolediator** is slightly stronger than the [[Wadjet]], with it having 180 Health and 10 Armor points. However, the attacks are easier to dodge due to its size, as the Kobolediator tends to move slower.

Upon being slain, the Kobolediator drops Ancient Metal Ingots, which are used to craft [[Cataclysm Items#Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate|Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate]].
