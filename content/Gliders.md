![[gliding_icon.webp | left | 200]] Gliders is a mod that brings... gliders to the game! To open up your glider, just put it on your chest or [[Curios API|back slot]], jump, and hit space!

You may see the glider perspective and operator items tab button clash in your settings. Don't worry, you're not missing out on anything. This is a known bug and does not affect gameplay or customization at all.
