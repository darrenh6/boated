The **Harbringer** is a powerful boss located deep underground. It must be activated with a Nether Star to begin combat. After powering up for a few seconds, the Harbinger will release a powerful laser onto enemies, dealing lots of damage. When this attack happens, the best thing you can do is simply run away and keep healing. Sometimes, the Harbinger will do a charge attack, which can destroy blocks within the arena.

Upon being slain, the Harbringer drops 9 Witherite Ingots, which can be used to craft the Mechanical Fusion Anvil. This Mechanical Fusion Anvil is required to upgrade certain Cataclysm gear.
