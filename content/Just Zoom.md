Just Zoom allows you to zoom by pressing a hotkey and adjust the zoom with your mouse wheel! It feels similar to zooming with the spyglass, but you can zoom in further and don't have the black bars and spyglass overlay blocking your view!

To get Optifine-like zooming, just turn off Smooth Zooming. By default, the Base FOV Modifier is 0.25.
