	Advancements/achievements now display a nicer looking plaque! Plaques come with custom sounds and work with all mods.
[[Alex's Caves]]
**Artifacts** (Relies on: [[Curios API]])
	Artifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted. The items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few locations in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.
[[AstikorCarts Redux]]
[[Basic End Ores]]
[[Ben's Sharks]]
[[Better Combat]]
**Better Third Person**

	Utilizes Curios to provide a slot for your Totem of Undying.

	Adds player heads next to chat messages, like those seen in the TAB list.

**Furnace Recycle**
	> Has been adapted to a datapack. Smelting armor will return 1 of its crafting recipe.
[[Gliders]]
[[Gnumus Settlement]] (Relies on: GeckoLib)
**Gravestone**
	Simple gravestone mod that holds your items after your death. Gives you an obituary with your inventory and coordinates after dying, until you find and loot your own grave.
**Hourglass**
	This mod (optionally) replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition to morning by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass faster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for any sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the duration of the night. **Hourglass allows for customization of the day-night cycle duration, and can control day and night speed independently.** Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make a day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more forgiving experience.
#### ON BOATED, THE DAY/NIGHT CYCLE IS 30 MINUTES DAY 15 MINUTES NIGHT

	A simple and configurable mod that makes all (even datapacks and modded) structures more spread out (or more common!), essentially making them rarer/easier to find.
**Tectonic**
	A world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped. Plains and other biomes are more expansive. Also makes river shapes more realistic, though this sometimes occurs in rivers running through mountains!
[[The Lost Castle]]
