The **Guling** is the main dungeon in EEEAB's Mobs. Only the new mobs from the mod can be found in this dungeon.

Upon finding the Guling using the [[EEEAB's Mobs#Getting Started|Eye of Guling]], you can enter the dungeon from the top. To clear the dungeon, you must defeat enemies and travel downwards through the different levels.

Valuable tombs can be found in the upper floor of the Guling. Weakness, mining fatigue, and slowness can sometimes be applied. This effect is best remedied with milk.
Depending on the rarity of the tomb, it will drop increasingly valuable drops such as [Enchanted Golden Apples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Golden_Apple) and [Diamonds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Diamond). Additionally, tombs can contain Armor Debris, [[EEEAB's Mobs Items#Immortal Bone|Immortal Bones]], and [[EEEAB's Mobs Items#Immortal Ingot|Immortal Ingots]].
