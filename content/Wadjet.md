The **Wadjet** is a miniboss within Cataclysm that naturally spawns within the Cursed Pyramid. It’s one of two minibosses that can be found here alongside the [[Kobolediator]].

The Wadjet will mostly make melee attacks, where it swings its spear at the player. This deals quite a bit of damage while also knocking the player back. Sometimes, the Wadjet will choose to charge at the player instead, impaling them with its spear. When the Wadjet raises its spear into the air, it’s about to summon falling sandblocks.

Upon being slain, the Wadjet drops Ancient Metal Ingots, which are used to craft [[Cataclysm Items#Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate|Bone Reptile Helmet and Chestplate]].
