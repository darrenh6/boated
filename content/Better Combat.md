This mod gives animations and accurate weapon collision detection to all weapons, including modded ones! It is recommended to turn on Show hands in first person. This mod also works in tandem with Better Third Person to provide the best third person combat experience. However, first person is still usually the most optimal way to play the game.

There is an option to set a Feint key bind. By default, this key is unbound. Feinting allows you to cancel an attack mid-animation.
