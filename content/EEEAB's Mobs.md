EEEAB's Mobs is a mod that introduces various weapons and mobs that spawn in a dungeon. The main boss of this mod is the Nameless Guardian.
# Getting Started
To find the first mini-boss of this mod, you need to craft an **Eye of Bloody Altar** and use it in the Nether. Like the [Eye of Ender](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Eye_of_Ender), it will bring you to a structure.

After reaching the Bloody Altar, you must defeat the [[Corpse Warlock]]. The Corpse Warlock will drop the Heart of Pagan, which can be used to brew Potion of Frenzy.
When Frenzied, you gain both strength and speed. This effect stacks with the default strength and speed effects.

To find the main dungeon of the mod, you need to craft an **Eye of Guling**. It is used in the same way as the Eye of Bloody Altar, but only works in the Overworld.

# [[Guling]]
After finding the Guling, you will encounter a variety of mobs, and more importantly, the [[Nameless Guardian]].
