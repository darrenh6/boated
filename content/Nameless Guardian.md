The **Nameless Guardian** is a boss that spawns in the lower most level of the Guling. 

> The Nameless Guardian is a war machine left over from ancient times, and even after a long time it still carries out its orders as a gatekeeper, which is to stop any creatures that try to enter the portal.

Its melee attacks make you temporarily unable to use your shield.
All of its melee attacks have a lifesteal effect.
The lower the amount of HP, the higher the frequency of attacks.
When hit by certain skills, it will fall into a "Stun" state.
When the boss's HP drops below 60%, it enters the power state.

**In this state, the boss has the following characteristics:**
- Cause more damage.
- Longer invulnerable time.
- Immunity to projectiles.
- Some skills have been strengthened.
- Unleash more dangerous skills.

Upon being slain, the Nameless Guardian drops the [[EEEAB's Mobs Items#Guardian Battleaxe|Guardian Battleaxe]] and [[EEEAB's Mobs Items#Guardian Core|Guardian Core]].
