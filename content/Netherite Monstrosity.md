The **Netherite Monstrosity** resides in the Soul Blacksmith, a massive Forge that can be located with a costly eye. Until a player comes nearby, the Monstrosity stays in a state of slumber.

This boss has a series of attacks. Its ranged attack spews pools of lava. In melee range, the Netherite Monstrosity knocks up enemies.

Upon being slain, the Netherite Monstrosity drops a Monstrous Horn, which can be used to upgrade a Netherite helmet to a [[Cataclysm Items#Monstrous Helmet|Monstrous Helmet]]. It also drops the [[Cataclysm Items#Infernal Forge|Infernal Forge]], which can be upgraded into a [[Cataclysm Items#Void Forge|Void Forge]].
