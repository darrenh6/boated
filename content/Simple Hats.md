Simple Hats is a JSON-configurable cosmetic hat mod that allows users to define their own hats with various additional options such as variants, dye-ability, particle effects, and seasonality. 

Hats can be obtained from grab-bags (Open with right-click) that drop from hostile mobs, or found in various loot chests. Unwanted or duplicate hats can be recycled to craft new or upgraded bags in order to get new or rarer hats.

Simple Hats uses [[Curios API]] for its Head slot to wear the hats.
