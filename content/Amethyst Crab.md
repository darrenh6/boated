The **Amethyst Crab** is a powerful miniboss that spawns in Lush Cave biomes. It has a series of slamming attacks that lunge at the player and cause knock up damage.

Upon being slain, the Amethyst Crab drops Amethyst Crab Shells, which are used to craft [[Cataclysm Items#Bloom Stone Pauldrons|Bloom Stone Pauldrons]]. Additionally, the Amethyst Crab drops Amethyst Crab Meat, which is used for blessed Amethyst Crab Meat. This meal will be needed to defeat the [[Leviathan]].
