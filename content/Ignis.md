**Ignis** is one of the strongest bosses in the server. You'll probably need some Notch apples to win this battle. He has three phases, which you can read more about on the [unofficial wiki](https://www.minecraft-guides.com/wiki/cataclysm/ignis/).

Upon being slain, Ignis drops 3 Ignitium Ingots. These ingots can be used in a smithing table to upgrade Netherite armor to the [[Cataclysm Items#Ignis Set|Ignis Set]]. Alternatively, they can be used to craft the [[Cataclysm Items#The Incinerator|Incinerator]] and [[Cataclysm Items#Bulwark of the Flame|Bulwark of the Flame]].
