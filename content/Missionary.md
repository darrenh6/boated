The mini-boss **Missionary** spirit appears only starting from the tenth day of the game. Always appears with two Zombie Villagers. It fights by firing magical projectiles at the player, and when it hits the target, it summons an evocation fang under the victim's feet. At the beginning of the battle, it can cause rain. When receiving damage, it periodically teleports and after a couple of seconds summons random undead. The ability to teleport and summon can be blocked by the effect of Magic Depletion, or attacks from the Nightmare Scythe. Can drop random charms after death.
