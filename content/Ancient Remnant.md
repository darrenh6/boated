The **Ancient Remnant** is a powerful boss that can be found in the Cursed Pyramid. It is totally immune to projectile damage, so make sure you bring a sword! To summon the Ancient Remnant, you must find Necklace of The Desert. You can acquire this item by brushing Suspicious Sand.

Upon being slain, the Ancient Remnant drops [[Cataclysm Items#Sand Storm in a Bottle|Sand Storm in a Bottle]] and a Remnant's Skull, which can be used to summon an untamed Modern Remnant. This Modern Remnant can be tamed using a Brush.
