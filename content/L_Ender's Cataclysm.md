Cataclysm is a mod that adds difficult dungeons, challenging boss-fights and powerful items. It is inspired by MC Dungeons. There is an [unofficial wiki](https://www.minecraft-guides.com/wiki/cataclysm/) which is mostly comprehensive and can help guide you through the bosses.

This page will detail some of the bosses as well as the balance changes made to their items.
