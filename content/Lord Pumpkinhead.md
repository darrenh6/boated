**Lord Pumpkinhead** is a strengthened version of Sir Pumpkinhead, as well as a full-fledged boss. In order to summon it, right-click on the Infernal Evil Pumpkin (no matter whether created or found) using Transmuting Elixir. Lord Pumpkinhead is a late game boss and requires maximum equipment or good resourcefulness to fight him.

Upon being slain, Lord Pumpkinhead drops the Soulbane, Pumpkin Pistol, and Lord Pumpkinhead's Lamp, which can be used to summon his steed.
