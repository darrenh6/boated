Warriors of Past Epoch is a mod that adds Musketeers and Plague Doctors.

For more information about this mod, visit its [official CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/warriors-of-past-epoch). Most things are largely unchanged; however, the Plagues have been disabled. The Surgical Saw still works!
