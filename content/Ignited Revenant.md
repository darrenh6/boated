The **Ignited Revenant** is a guardian of the Burning Arena. In each Burning Area, there will only be two Ignited Revenants. They are similar to the vanilla Blazes. Surrounding each blaze is a shield that blocks attacks.

Upon being slain, it will drop Burning Ashes. Back upstairs on the main floor of the Burning Arena, these Burning Ashes can be used on the Altar of Fire located in the middle, which is the only way to summon [[Ignis]].
